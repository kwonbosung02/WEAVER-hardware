## What is Weaver?

### Weaver-Version 1.

### Overview

Write about Weaver entry into the International Robot Olympiad 2018.

### Production Purpose

More than one-fifth of the creatures in the oceans live in coral areas.
Right now, coral reefs are being destroyed by the departmentation of the sea.
When coral reefs are destroyed, more than one-fifth of all sea creatures will lose their homes.

Sea waste is now a global problem. Countries have come up with several alternatives to reduce ocean waste, but they have not been resolved. Marine waste not only pollutes the sea, but also threatens marine life forms.
These various reasons put the sea in danger. To protect the marine environment and make life safe, we collect robots that stop department phenomenon and create environment for coral.
The wandering garbage is killing many creatures in the belief that it was fed.

<br>
Therefore, we decided to make robots like this because we thought we needed to come up with a solution.

### Goal

It prevents the department that destroys marine ecosystem, creates an environment where coral reefs can live again, and cleans the ocean waste by floating it on the ocean.
It restores the marine ecosystem.

### Function

When the robot Weaver lands on a coral reef by shipping, it uses three BLDC motors.
It floats on the surface of the sea and drops a dry ice wrapped in the same material as an omu.
When dry ice evaporates and expands, the membrane breaks and spreads carbon dioxide.
The calcium carbonate that make up the coral, the carbon dioxide that is spread by the evaporation of dry ice, and the concentration of water in the sea, which creates calcium carbonate, which can melt and live in the coral.
<br>
It also floats on the ocean to collect waste from the ocean, preventing marine life from being affected by the waste.
<br>
GPS sensors can be used to locate a number of Weaver parts of the ocean, which can be found on a web page. The web page allows users to check and adjust digitized data such as the location of Weaver, when it was dropped by Weaver, the pH level at sea, and the temperature at sea.

### Characteristics

Use this to create an environment in which coral can be created.
Collect the trash and make the sea cleaner.
The current status of the ocean can be easily checked via web page.
